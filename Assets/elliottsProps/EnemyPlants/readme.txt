Thank you for purchasing my plant assets!

I will continue to update and add more species as often as I can, here are some things you should know:

-Both Enemy Plant and Environment Plant share the same Material.
-Default albedo is gray/white, change it in inspector to the color you wish.
-Animations are all stationary.
-The spell animation on plants is used differently for each plant. Clarification; Plant1, 2 and 3's spell animation is a channeling animation while Plant4's goes underground.
